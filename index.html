            A tale that takes place in an ordinary town with ordinary people. <br><br>

            In fact, he's not a <em>person</em> at all. . .

               When Walter Melon was a younger melon, it was often said that he would never be mistaken for a handsome melon. <br>
               Unfortunately for Walter, this happened to be the truth. 
            </p>
            <p>
               But, Walter was a dreamer. Walter's dream was to become the greatest singer the world had ever known. <br>
               Walter would sing for anyone and anything around. He would sing in the shower. He would sing while he cooked. <br>
               He would sing while he drove. He would sing while he worked. He would sing to family members and friends. <br>
               He would even sing to complete strangers.However, another unfortunate circumstance existed. . . <br>
               Walter was not a very good singer. 
            </p>
            <p>
               (That's actually putting it lightly. It was often said that Walter's singing would make the alley cats howl. <br>
               In some instances, people were known to run their fingernails down chalk boards just to drown out his serenades. But, I digress. . .)

            <p>
               Then, on one random sunny day, Walter was out for a roll. He was crooning as usual, when he came upon a man he had never seen before. <br>
               Walter was not shy so he introduced himself, "Hi! I'm Walter!" The stranger replied, "Hello Walter. My name is Vincent Man Gogh. <br>
               That's quite a voice you've got there." Walter replied, "Oh, thank you! I just love to sing!" <br>
               Vincent responded, "I didn't mean it as a compliment, Walter. But, if singing is your passion, perhaps I can be of assistance. <br>
               I happen to be a traveling salesman and I believe that what I sell could be of great assistance to you. <br>
               You see, I sell magic pills that will make your absolute greatest wish come true. Are you interested?" 
            </p>
            <p>
               Walter was known to be quite gullable, and would do anything to become a famous singer. <br>
               "Mr. Man Gogh, you have a deal!", he said. He forked over the money, grabbed the pill and rolled home as fast as he could. <br>
               "Walter, wait! I haven't told you about the side effects!", Vincent shouted after Walter. <br>
               But, as was his usual, Walter was singing loudly as he rolled and couldn't hear the warning. 
            </p>

         <article class = "walterAches">
            <p>
               Walter made it home in record time. He rushed to his kitchen and turned on the faucet. <br>
               He was in such a rush to swallow the pill that he almost fumbled it down the drain. <br>
               (You may be wondering why Walter didn't just swallow the pill as soon as Vincent gave it to him. <br>
               After all Walter, like the watermelons you and I know, is made up of 90% water. <br>
               However, Walter suffered from severe dry mouth. Poor Walter's mouth was so dry, <br>
               he made a cat's tongue seem like a moist sponge. But once again, I digress. . .) 
            </p>
            <p>
               Once Walter swallowed the pill (washed down with the largest glass of water he owned), <br>
               there was nothing left for Walter to do but wait. So, he waited... <br><br>
               and waited. . . <br><br>
               and waited some more. . . 
            </p>
            <p>
               Walter waited until he couldn't wait anymore. After what seemed like forever (it was about 42 minutes), <br>
               Hector decided to test out his new superstar vocals. He opened his mouth. . .<br><br>
               took a deep breath. . .<br><br>
               and let out the most cringe-inducing tune that any person (or melon) had ever heard.
            </p>
            <p>   
               Forget howling in the alleys. Any cat that was in hearing distance of Walter <br>
               on this day ran away so fast and so far, they haven't been seen since. <br>
               Unfortunately for Walter, his now-even-more-terrible singing wasn't even the worst part. <br>
               After his eardrum-bursting melody, Walter then proceeded to vomit. . . <br><br>
               and vomit. . . <br><br>
               and vomit some more. . . 
            </p>

            <div class="caption">Poor Walter</div>

            <p>
               Walter vomited so much that he tasted what he ate a week prior. That wouldn't have been so bad had it not happened all over himself. <br>
               Those things combined wouldn't have been the worst thing to happen if they weren't also accompanied by a feeling of absolute dread. <br>
               But, they <em>were</em> accompanied by that feeling of absolute dread, and that's putting that feeling lightly. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Walter's head started spinning. His eyes started spinning. The whole room started spinning! <br>
               And his stomach...oh, his stomach! Walter had never felt such agonizing pain before. <br>
               He was sure the end was near. If this truly was the end of the Walter Melon legacy, <br>
               he would rather not be found in a pool of his own filth. So, Walter mustered up what little strength he had left and rolled himself to the shower.
            </p>

            <div class="caption">Walter feeling like death is near</div>

            <p>
               Walter managed to clean himself up and roll his way to bed, where he passed out, feeling like he was knocking on death's door. <br>
               Walter's dreams that evening were very, <em>very</em> interesting. . .

               When Walter woke up the next day, he felt better. In fact, he felt <em>much</em> better! <br>
               His head wasn't spinning. His stomach didn't feel like it was turned inside out. <br>
               Walter felt better than he'd ever felt in his entire life! Walter shot out of bed, rolled to the bathroom, <br>
               and looked in the mirror. He looked the same as he always did but something felt different.
            </p>   
            <p>   
               He felt a confidence he'd only ever dreamt of. He felt...he felt...he felt like he wanted to sing! <br>
               So he sang. He sang high notes <em>and</em> low notes. He sang alto <em>and</em> soprano. <br>
               He sang country. He sang pop. He sang rock. He sang R & B. He sang the hits. He sang the deep cuts. <br>
               He sang loud and proud...and he sounded great! 
            </p>
            <p>
               Melons from all over the world came to listen to Walter sing. He became a mega-star! <br>
               He set records for albums sold. He set records for audience sizes. <br>
               He was loved the world over. There wasn't a melon in the world who wasn't a fan of Walter Melon.

            <p>
               Setting attendance and albums-sold records wouldn't be the only records set by Walter. <br>
               He would go on to make more money than any singing melon ever had...and grew tired of being so hideous-looking. <br>
               So, Walter set one more record. He set the record for spending the most amount of money ever spent on plastic surgery.
