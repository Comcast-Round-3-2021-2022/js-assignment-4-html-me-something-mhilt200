         <h1>The Ballad of Walter Melon</h1>
         <h2>(or How One Unfortunate Fruit Became One Extraordinary Star)</h2>
         <p>This tale takes place in an ordinary town with ordinary people. <br>
         But the person to whom it happens is anything but ordinary. <br>
         In fact, he's not a <em>person</em> at all...

      <p>When Walter Melon was a younger melon, it was often <br>
         said that he would never be mistaken for a handsome man. <br>
         Unfortunately for Walter, this happened to be the truth. <br>
          </p>

      <p>But, Walter was dreamer. Walter's dream was to become <br>
         the greatest singer the world had ever known. <br>
         Walter would sing for anyone and anything around. <br>
         He would sing while he cooked. He would sing in the shower. <br>
         He would sing while he drove. He would sing while he worked. <br>
         He would sing to family members and friends. <br>
         He would even sing to complete strangers.<br>
         However, another unfortunate circumstance existed... <br>
         Walter was not a very good singer. <br><br>
         (That's actually putting it lightly. It was often said <br>
         that Walter's singing would make the alley cats howl. <br>
         In some instances, people were known to run their fingernails <br>
         down chalk boards just to drown out his serenades. But, I digress.) <br><br>
         Then, on one random sunny day, Walter was out for a stroll. <br>
         He was crooning as usual, when he came upon a man he had never seen before. <br>
         Walter was not shy so he introduced himself, "Hi! I'm Walter!". <br>
         The stranger replied, "Hello Walter. My name is Vincent Man Gogh. That's quite a voice you've got there." <br>
         "Oh, thank you! I just love to sing!", replied Walter. <br>
         Vincent responded, "I didn't mean it as a compliment, Walter. But, if singing is your passion, perhaps I can be of assistance. <br>
         I happen to be a traveling salesman and I believe that what I sell could be of great assistance to you. <br>
         You see, I sell magic pills that will make your absolute greatest wish come true. Are you interested?" <br>
         Walter was known to be quite gullable, and would do anything to become a famous singer. <br>
         "Mr. Man Gogh, you have a deal!", he said. He forked over the money, grabbed the pill and ran home. <br>
         "Walter, wait! I haven't told you about the side effects!", Vincent shouted after Walter. <br>
         But, as was his usual, Walter was singing loudly as he ran and couldn't hear the warning.</p>
